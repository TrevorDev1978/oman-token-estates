    question: "Is this a real property purchase?",
    answer: "Yes. Each token represents legal fractional ownership of a real-world property in Oman, approved by government entities and tied to legal title deeds."
  },
  {
    question: "What blockchain is used?",
    answer: "The platform is built on the Avalanche (AVAX) blockchain for high scalability, low fees, and robust developer support."
  },
  {
    question: "What is ERC-3643?",
    answer: "Itâ€™s a security token standard that allows for controlled transfers, identity-based permissions, and metadata updates. Perfect for regulated real estate tokenization."
  },
  {
    question: "What do I earn by investing?",
    answer: "You earn proportional rental yield and value appreciation. If a property is rented for $100,000 and you own 10%, you get $10,000 (minus fees)."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I cash out anytime?",
    answer: "Yes. You can sell your ownership tokens on the secondary marketplace or transfer them to another whitelisted user."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I lose access to my wallet?",
